            After the interview process, creating personas, crafting journeys, and compiling accessibility resources, I
            began prototyping solutions. These prototypes address the specific issues faced by my user personas.

            <p class="proto-desc friend-descOne">Fake Friend was developed in response to Robert's persona, where
                he expressed
                his feelings about
                his bot experience. I began to think about how Facebook could intervene and inform its users about bots
                or “fake friends”. I drew inspiration from LinkedIn's shared connections and came up with this interface
                to both warn and educate users. </p>

                alt="Image of a popup box overtop of Facebooks friend screen desktop view. The popup box reads are you sure you know this person. You share no mutual friends with this person and the account has some characteristics that are similar to a spam account. With two buttons that say learn more and okay.">

                alt="Image of a popup box overtop of Facebooks friend screen desktop view. The popup box reads are you sure you know this person.Do you know the requester or have any friends in common? Is the friend request from an attractive person of the oposite sex?
Does this person have a limited Facebook history? Does this person have unusally large or small number of friends? Are they all the same sex?. With a button that says okay">

            <p class="friend-descTwo proto-desc ">When creating the educational pop-up screen, I first researched types
                of
                spam
                accounts and what warning
                signs they possessed. My next step was to think about the tone and language that I would be using. How
                would
                I fit it into the existing tone that Facebook has created while making it understandable for the age
                demographic that I am targeting? I decided to present the information as a series of questions that the
                user could ask themselves before accepting or deleting the friend request.
