        <p class="u-fontWeightReg u-secondaryFont uj-introPara introPara_styles"> After creating the
            personas, I analyzed a key issue brought up in the interview and created a user journey to examine before,
            during, and after the issue. I thought about what the user is doing, why they are doing it, how the user
            might be thinking or feeling, what is frustrating them, and how we as designers could potentially improve
            the interaction. These user journeys allowed me to start to think about design improvements through the lens
            of the user.
